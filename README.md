# Library Management System (Task 1 - Advanced)

A simple project that simulates a library system using **JavaScript OOP concepts**.  
The goal is to practice classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and DOM interaction.

## Features
- Display, search, filter, add, and remove books.
- Toggle availability (Available / Not Available).
- `ReferenceBook` class extends `Book` with a location code.

## Notes
I was not able to fully apply the `displayInfo()` method in DOM rendering, but the overriding concept is included in the code.

## Tech
- HTML + CSS + JavaScript

## Future Improvements
- Correctly use `displayInfo()` in the UI.
- Add persistent storage with `localStorage`.
- Improve styling and layout.
